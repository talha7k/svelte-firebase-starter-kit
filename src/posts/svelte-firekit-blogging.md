# Svelte Firekit: A Modern Blog-Enabled Firebase Starter Template

Building a modern web application with authentication, blog functionality, and proper SEO can be a time-consuming process. Svelte Firekit is a production-ready starter template that combines the power of SvelteKit, Firebase, and TypeScript to help developers launch their projects faster.

## Rich Blogging System

At the heart of Svelte Firekit is a robust blogging system designed with content creators in mind. The template includes a well-structured type system that makes managing blog posts intuitive and type-safe:

```typescript
interface Post {
    slug: string;
    title: string;
    publishedAt: Date;
    content: any;
    frontmatter: PostFrontmatter;
    published: boolean;
}
```

Each blog post supports rich frontmatter with comprehensive metadata options:

- **Basic Metadata**: Title, publish date, and author information
- **Content Organization**: Tags, categories, and excerpts

- **SEO Optimization**: Built-in SEO fields including custom titles, descriptions, and Open Graph images

```typescript
interface PostState {
    posts: Map<string, Post>;
    isLoaded: boolean;

This structure ensures:
- Efficient post lookup using Map data structure
