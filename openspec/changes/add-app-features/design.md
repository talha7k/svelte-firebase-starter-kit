## Context

This change adds core application features to transform the starter kit into a functional web application. The implementation focuses on user experience, real-time capabilities, and modern UI patterns while maintaining the existing Firebase and SvelteKit architecture.

## Goals / Non-Goals

- Goals: Complete user management system, real-time notifications, messaging functionality, file handling
- Non-Goals: Email system integration, advanced admin panel, file sharing between users

## Decisions

- Decision: Use Firestore for notifications and messages with real-time listeners
  - Alternatives considered: WebSocket server, Server-sent events
  - Rationale: Firebase provides built-in real-time capabilities and offline support
- Decision: Use browser-native image compression API
  - Alternatives considered: Server-side compression, Cloudinary integration
  - Rationale: Reduces server load and provides immediate feedback
- Decision: Replace Lucide with Iconify exclusively
  - Alternatives considered: Keep both libraries, use custom SVGs
  - Rationale: Iconify provides comprehensive icon sets with consistent API

## Risks / Trade-offs

- Real-time features may increase Firestore usage costs
- Image compression in browser may affect performance on large files
- Icon dependency changes require updating all components

## Migration Plan

1. Implement new features alongside existing functionality
2. Gradually replace icons across the codebase
3. Update package.json and run dependency cleanup
4. Test all affected routes and components

## Open Questions

- Should notifications be persistent or session-based?
- What file size limits for uploads?
- Should messaging support group conversations or only 1-on-1?
- Role management granularity (admin, moderator, user)?
